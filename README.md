 <p align="center">Next-generation web framework to build powerful apps</p>
</p>

## Features

- **Simple**: No more `req` or `res`. It's all `ctx` (context) and plain objects!
- **Fast**: Built from the ground up with performance in mind. Zero, Zilch, Nada dependencies.
- **Typescript-first**: Built with type-safety in mind, first-class support.
- **Flexible**: Completely flexible with access to the all events, and data.
- **Simple error handling**: No more try-catch all around. It's just eviate, you and a `onError` function here.
- **Middleware**: Powerful middleware support. Route-specific, Route-independent, aswell pre-request and post-request middlewares.
- **Plugins**: Built with user in mind, the best plugin support to make it super easy to ship anything.

## Getting started

### Installation and setup

One of the _quickest_ ways to get started is to use `create-eviate-app`.

Get started by scaffolding the app real quick using:

```ts
npx create-eviate-app
```

### Manual setup

If you want to setup the app manually, you can do so.

**NOTE**: Ensure you have bun installed (node is not yet supported).

Get started by quickly installing the dependencies.

```ts
bun install eviate
```

Now, create a file called `app.ts` and add the following code:

```ts
import { Engine } from 'eviate';

const app = new Engine();

app.get('/', ctx => {
  return {
    text: 'Hello world!'
  };
});

app.listen();
```
